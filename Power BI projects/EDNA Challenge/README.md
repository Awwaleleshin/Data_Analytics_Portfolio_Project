# INTRODUCTION

I accepted Enterprise DNA Call Center Challenge #19.

EDNA’s Call Centre, one of the biggest call centres globally has requested my services to prepare a report that summarise, the overall service provided by EDNA’s Call Centres and enabling its senior Management to have a better view of its operations. EDNA’s Call Centre has put together a small dataset sample, around 100,000 Rows for exploration.

## THE DATASET

CSV file containing calls data for the year of 2018

CSV file containing calls data for the year of 2019

CSV file containing calls data for the year of 2020

Excel file containing two-dimension tables Call Type

Excel file containing two-dimension tables Call Centre employees or Reps

Data-dictionary

## Additional files were received from EDNA’s Call Centres CEO two weeks after commencement of the project;

CSV file containing calls data for the year of 2021.

Excel file containing calls data for the year of 2021 (in case of errors with CSV file).

Excel file containing call charges per minute for the years of 2018 to 2021

Excel file Data Dictionary about call charges.

## Further instructions were given for the project;

Delete a column in the Calls data files named “Call Abandoned”.

Create a new column in the Calls data files, name it “SLA Compliance” This column includes a logical statement wherein Calls “Waittime” is less than 35 seconds . Column results must be “Within SLA” or “Outside SLA”.

## DATA CLEANING

The datasets were extremely dirty, I had to perform a series of transformations on them to make them clean. The steps applied are in the pictures attached below
