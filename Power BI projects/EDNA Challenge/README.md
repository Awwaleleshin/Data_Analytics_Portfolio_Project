# INTRODUCTION

I accepted Enterprise DNA Call Center Challenge #19.

EDNA’s Call Centre, one of the biggest call centres globally has requested my services to prepare a report that summarise, the overall service provided by EDNA’s Call Centres and enabling its senior Management to have a better view of its operations. EDNA’s Call Centre has put together a small dataset sample, around 100,000 Rows for exploration.

## Further instructions were given for the project;

Delete a column in the Calls data files named “Call Abandoned”.

Create a new column in the Calls data files, name it “SLA Compliance” This column includes a logical statement wherein Calls “Waittime” is less than 35 seconds . Column results must be “Within SLA” or “Outside SLA”.
